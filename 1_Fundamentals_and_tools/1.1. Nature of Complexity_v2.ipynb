    "\n",
    "In this example, we've quantified complexity using Shannon entropy for three different systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ordered System**: All elements are identical (all zeros), resulting in zero entropy. This system is completely predictable and has no complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mixed System**: Half zeros and half ones, arranged in a structured pattern. This system has some entropy (1 bit), indicating moderate complexity or information content.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Random System**: Randomly distributed zeros and ones. This system has entropy close to 1 bit (the maximum for a binary system), indicating maximum uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates an important principle in complex systems: true complexity often lies between complete order and complete randomness. Many complex systems exhibit this \"edge of chaos\" behavior where they have enough structure to maintain organization but enough randomness to adapt and evolve."
