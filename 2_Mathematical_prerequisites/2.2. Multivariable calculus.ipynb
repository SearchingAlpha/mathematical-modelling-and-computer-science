    "\n",
    "1. **Critical Points**: We found one critical point at (0, 0), which is a minimum. This is the equilibrium point of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gradient Field**: The gradient vectors point radially outward from the minimum, showing the direction of steepest increase.\n",
    "\n",

    "4. **Physical Interpretation**: If this were an energy landscape, objects would naturally roll downhill toward the minimum energy state at (0, 0). In an ecological context, this might represent evolution toward an optimal trait combination.\n",

    "5. **System Stability**: The positive determinant and trace of the Hessian at the critical point confirm it's a stable equilibrium (minimum), meaning small perturbations will result in forces that push the system back toward equilibrium.\n",
