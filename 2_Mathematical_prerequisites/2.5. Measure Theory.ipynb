    "   - The $k$-th moment $E[X^k]$ of a Pareto distribution exists only if $k < \\alpha$\n",
    "   - This is a characteristic property of heavy-tailed distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "4. For the complex systems application, consider:\n",
    "   - Generating a network with a power-law degree distribution\n",
    "   - Analyzing how the network's properties depend on the parameter $\\alpha$\n",

    "Good luck! This exercise will deepen your understanding of measure theory, Lebesgue integration, and their applications to complex systems with heavy-tailed distributions."
