    "1. The network has 8 people (nodes) and 10 friendship connections (edges).\n",

    "3. The clustering coefficient varies among individuals, indicating different levels of social cohesion.\n",
    "4. The network has a diameter of 3, meaning that any two people can reach each other through at most 3 connections.\n",

    "   - By degree centrality: People with the most direct friends\n",
    "   - By betweenness centrality: People who serve as bridges between different groups\n",
    "   - By closeness centrality: People who can reach others most efficiently\n",
