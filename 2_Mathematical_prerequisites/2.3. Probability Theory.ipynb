    "1. The population distribution converges to a steady state relatively quickly.\n",

    "3. The theoretical steady state can be calculated directly from the transition matrix.\n",

This is a common property of irreducible and aperiodic Markov chains, where regardless of the starting state, the probability distribution will converge to a unique stationary distribution.\n",

    "\n",
    "Epidemiologists are studying the spread of a new disease. Based on limited data, they initially believe that the basic reproduction number (R₀) of the disease is between 1.5 and 3.5, with a most likely value around 2.5. This can be modeled as a prior probability distribution.\n",

    "### Analysis Questions\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. How did the posterior distribution change compared to the prior? Did the data strengthen or weaken our initial beliefs?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What would happen to the posterior if we had observed only 10 out of 20 index cases infecting others? What about 20 out of 20?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How could you improve this model? What other factors might you consider when modeling disease transmission?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In complex systems modeling, why is the Bayesian approach particularly useful compared to frequentist methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "These exercises have demonstrated how probability theory and stochastic processes can be applied to model complex systems with uncertainty. In the first exercise, we analyzed a Markov chain model of population movement between urban districts, showing how systems can reach equilibrium states over time. In the second exercise, you practiced Bayesian analysis for epidemiological modeling, updating prior beliefs about disease transmissibility based on observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These probabilistic methods are crucial for complex systems modeling because they allow us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Incorporate uncertainty and variability into our models\n",
    "2. Make predictions based on incomplete information\n",
    "3. Update our beliefs systematically as new data becomes available\n",
    "4. Understand how random processes can lead to emergent patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "As you progress through the course, you'll see how these concepts connect with other mathematical frameworks and computational methods for analyzing complex systems."
